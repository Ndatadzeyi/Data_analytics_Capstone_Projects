The Titanic dataset contains information about passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, including their demographic data, cabin class, fare, ticket information, survival status, etc. The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features

I provided Titanic Eda and the report for Titanic Eda

I got the dataset from Kaggle.com
